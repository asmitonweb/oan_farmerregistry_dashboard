# Farmer Registry — dashboard UI image.
#
# The analytics dashboard is a self-contained Next.js app in dashboard-ui/. It is
# a separate service rather than part of the Staff Portal because the portal
# ships as a prebuilt image that cannot be extended with new routes — the portal
# only gains a header button that navigates here (docker/staff-ui/assets/
# patch-dashboard-nav.js).
#
# It reads the registry database this stack runs — the same one the Staff Portal's
# API writes to — plus master-data for the country pack behind the geography
# filters. Both connections are configured by the DB_*/MD_DB_* variables on the
# dashboard-ui service in docker-compose.yml and are only ever used for SELECTs.
#
# This is NOT the Superset bundle in docker/dashboards. That one ships charts for
# the G2P Insight deployment; this is the in-product dashboard the portal links
# to, and the two share no code.
#
# Node 24 rather than 20: the lockfile is resolved by npm 11, which older images
# ship too old a npm to read with `npm ci`, and one transitive dependency
# declares node >=22.
#
# Build context = repo root.

# hoists dependencies that a macOS-resolved lockfile does not list, and `npm ci`
# rejects the difference:
#
#     docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/w -w /w node:24-slim npm install --package-lock-only
